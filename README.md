# ParcelShare

This is a file sharing application, **purposefully built for fast and easy file sharing between individuals** in real time, I built this application to demonstrate my competence in working with and managing databases and to explore more indept features.

### The features of this project includes:

1. It Works by allowing for sharing of files/directories between users, and you can also make friends where the files/directories you store is seen and accessible by your friends.(share)
2. It allows for creating groups, where the files can be shared and instantly accessible to members of the group
3. It allows for creating specific hashed links, which can be shared and accessed by anyone and ability to create special restriction of setting limits to number of users which the file applies or period in which files is available, The shared link can also be protected from random access by incuding a password.
4. Since this is on the web, i aim to make this more accessible and convinient by making the app a Progressive Web App(PWA), which can run offline, improving initial load time, and quick accessibility.
5. Unfortunately i don't have exhobitent storage capacity in my atlas collection, so i intend to delete every file that last more than 7 days, so the application can keep running. But users will be alerted 3 days before this action.

### Stages of Development:

- [ ] Create Attractive UI Interface, that satisfies all the requirements, pages, and components, needed by the user to intaract with this application.
  - [ ] I'll use Adobe XD to satisfy this requirement.
- [ ] Develop Frontend using React, Vite, Typescript + SWC, to create and implement interface from UI design
- [ ] Develop Backend using MongoDB Database, Express, Mongoose as a Node Driver to store files, authenticate users, and other neccessary file encryption techniques to prevent random anccess

## Development Process:

**Developed UI**

Well i didn't want to waste much time in developing every look of the UI, instead i used a fileshare application UI base i found online. It have most of the features i needed a good appearance and good color scheme, and i just needed to replace the necessary data using it as a base for more innovation.

**Setting Up Files**

1. I used the Font Montserrat as Primary Font, and Nonito as Secondary Font, downloaded it and converted it to woff2 format.
2. Installed the following dependencies:
   - vite, tailwind, sass, antd, react-router

Imported All Base Assets Created.
